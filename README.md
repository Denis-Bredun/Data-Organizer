## âš  Firebase Authentication Deprecation Warning

The following authentication features will stop working when Firebase Dynamic Links shuts down on **25 August 2025**:

- Email link authentication for mobile apps  
- Cordova OAuth support for web apps

If you use `EMAIL_SIGNIN` (`OOB_REQ_TYPE.EMAIL_SIGNIN`) or similar features, **your users will no longer be able to sign up or sign in via email link on mobile platforms**.

Firebaseâ€™s official recommendation is to migrate to alternative methods, such as:

- Standard email/password authentication  
- OAuth2 providers (Google, Microsoft, etc.)  
- A custom backend-based authentication flow

If no action is taken, these features will continue working **only until 25 August 2025**.
